# Validator Personal Todo List

This is YOUR testing and verification tracking. Check central board every 30 minutes for Builder completions to verify.

## CRITICAL: Check for Builder Completions

**TASK-202 (FileMonitor) may be completed but not verified yet. Check immediately!**

## Current Session Priority
- [ ] Check if TASK-202 (FileMonitor) is actually completed by Builder
- [ ] Verify FileMonitor service implementation
- [ ] Update central board with verification results
- [ ] Begin testing available components

## Detailed Work Items

### Immediate Verification Tasks
- [ ] Pull Builder's latest commits
- [ ] Locate FileMonitor.ts implementation
- [ ] Run unit tests for FileMonitor
- [ ] Verify implementation meets requirements
- [ ] Update central task-board.json with verification status

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Complete test setup for FileMonitor (waiting for verification)
- [ ] Implement unit tests for file monitoring
- [ ] Create integration tests for git monitoring
- [ ] Set up test data factories

### Quality Verification
- [ ] Check code coverage on Builder's work
- [ ] Run security scans
- [ ] Verify TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Test error handling

## Test Implementation Pipeline
1. **FileMonitor Service** (Priority 1)
   - Unit tests for all methods
   - Integration tests with git
   - Performance tests
   - Error handling verification

2. **Backend APIs** (waiting for completion)
3. **Frontend Components** (waiting for completion)

## Coordination Tasks
- [ ] Monitor central task board every 30 minutes
- [ ] Verify all Builder completions within 30 minutes
- [ ] Report test results immediately
- [ ] Unblock dependent tasks after verification

## Notes
- Builder appears to have completed FileMonitor but coordination is unclear
- May have test suites already prepared that need activation
- Focus on breaking the dependency bottleneck

## Session Goals
1. Verify Builder's completed work
2. Activate testing pipeline
3. Update coordination status
4. Enable next phase development
