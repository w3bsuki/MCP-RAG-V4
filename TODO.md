# Builder Personal Todo List

This is YOUR detailed implementation tracking. Update immediately after each task and sync completions to central board.

## CRITICAL: Update Central Board on Completions

**If you completed TASK-202 (FileMonitor), update the central task-board.json immediately so Validator can proceed!**

## Current Session Priority
- [ ] Fix nested directory structure (/src/backend/src/backend/)
- [ ] Commit completed FileMonitor service
