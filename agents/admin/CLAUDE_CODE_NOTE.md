# Important: Haiku Routing in Claude Code vs Production

## Current Situation (Claude Code)

When using Claude Code (like you are now), you have:
- Direct access to Claude Opus/Sonnet through the interface
- No API keys needed
- No separate Haiku access

## What We Built

The Haiku routing implementation is **production-ready** code that:
- Simulates Haiku routing for testing
- Falls back to keyword matching (works now)
- Ready to use real Haiku when you deploy with API keys

## How It Works Now

1. **In Claude Code** (your current setup):
   - Admin Agent uses simulated Haiku routing (keyword matching)
   - All actual agents use your Claude Code session (Opus/Sonnet)
   - No API calls, no extra costs

2. **In Production** (future deployment):
   - Admin Agent would use real Haiku API ($0.25/1M tokens)
   - Worker agents would use Opus/Sonnet API ($15/1M tokens)
   - Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in .env

## Key Point

**You don't need Haiku API access for development!**

The code works perfectly now with:
- Simulated routing (fast keyword matching)
- Real agent work done by your Claude Code session
- Same routing decisions, just without API calls

## When You'd Use Real Haiku

Only when deploying to production:
```python
# Production code (not needed for Claude Code):
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Client(api_key=os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'))
response = await client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-haiku-20240307",
    max_tokens=50,
    messages=[...]
)
```

## Summary

- **Now**: Everything works with Claude Code, no API needed
- **Future**: Ready for Haiku when you deploy
- **Cost**: $0 extra for you right now
- **Benefit**: Code is production-ready
