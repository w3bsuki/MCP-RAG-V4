### 2. Agent Communication Architecture

```yaml
# .swarm/config.yaml (claude-swarm pattern)
swarm:
  orchestrator:
    description: "Lead coordinator managing all agents"
    mcp_servers:
      - task-server
      - rag-server
    connections:
      - architect
      - builder
      - validator

  agents:
    architect:
      description: "System design and architecture"
      workspace: ".worktrees/architect"
      mcp_servers:
        - rag-server
        - bridge-server
      allowed_tools:
        - read
        - write
        - search
      system_prompt: |
        You are the system architect. Design scalable solutions.
        Query RAG for patterns. Document decisions in knowledge/.

    builder:
      description: "Implementation and coding"
      workspace: ".worktrees/builder"
      mcp_servers:
        - rag-server
        - bridge-server
        - task-server
      allowed_tools:
        - all
      system_prompt: |
        You are the builder. Implement solutions following architect's design.
        Always run npm install. Test your code. Update task status.

    validator:
      description: "Testing and quality assurance"
      workspace: ".worktrees/validator"
      mcp_servers:
        - task-server
        - bridge-server
      allowed_tools:
        - read
        - bash
        - test
      system_prompt: |
        You are the validator. Verify all implementations work.
        Run tests. Check deployments. Block bad code.
```

### 3. MCP Server Architecture

#### RAG Server (Enhanced)
```typescript
// .mcp/rag-server.ts
- Vector database for semantic search
- Pattern matching with success metrics
- Automatic indexing of knowledge/
- Query interface for all agents
```

#### Task Server (Verification)
```typescript
// .mcp/task-server.ts
- Real execution tracking (not just status)
- Dependency verification
- Progress monitoring
- Blocker detection
```

#### Bridge Server (Communication)
```typescript
// .mcp/bridge-server.ts
- Inter-agent messaging
- Context sharing
- File sync notifications
- Collaboration requests
```

### 4. Workflow Orchestration

#### Initialization Workflow
```typescript
// orchestration/workflows/init-project.ts
1. Orchestrator receives project request
2. Architect designs solution → knowledge/decisions/
3. Builder sets up project:
   - cd .worktrees/builder/projects/projectX
   - npm init / create-next-app
   - npm install (VERIFIED by task-server)
   - Initial commit
4. Validator creates test suite
5. All agents sync via bridge-server
```

#### Development Workflow
```typescript
// orchestration/workflows/implement-feature.ts
1. Architect queries RAG for patterns
2. Architect creates design doc
3. Builder implements in worktree
4. Task-server verifies actual execution
5. Validator runs tests in separate worktree
6. Bridge-server syncs results
7. Orchestrator merges if approved
```

### 5. Key Innovations

#### A. Smart Worktrees (from claude-squad)
- Each agent has persistent worktree
- No conflicts between agents
- Full repo access with isolation
- Automatic branch management

#### B. MCP Communication (from claude-swarm)
- Agents communicate via MCP protocol
- Structured message passing
- Context preservation
- Tool sharing capabilities

#### C. Orchestration Layer (from claude-flow)
- Predefined workflows
- Automatic task routing
- Progress verification
- Real-time monitoring

#### D. Verification System (new)
- Task-server tracks ACTUAL execution
- Screenshots for UI validation
- Log analysis for backend verification
- Deployment health checks

### 6. Implementation Benefits

1. **No More Stuck Agents**: Full repo access in worktrees
2. **Real Task Completion**: Verification server ensures work is done
3. **Agent Collaboration**: MCP bridges enable communication
4. **Knowledge Retention**: RAG server with vector search
5. **Clear Structure**: One source of truth for each concern
6. **Scalable**: Add more agents easily with new worktrees

### 7. Agent Capabilities

Each agent can:
- Run ANY command in their worktree (npm install, tests, etc.)
- Communicate with other agents via MCP
- Query shared knowledge base
- Update task status with verification
- Work independently without conflicts

## Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Set up proper worktrees
2. **Phase 2**: Implement MCP servers
3. **Phase 3**: Create orchestration layer
4. **Phase 4**: Migrate existing projects
5. **Phase 5**: Train agents on new workflow

This architecture solves ALL current problems:
- ✅ Agents can install dependencies
- ✅ No more nested folders confusion
- ✅ Real task verification
- ✅ Inter-agent communication
- ✅ Knowledge sharing via RAG
- ✅ Clear, maintainable structure
