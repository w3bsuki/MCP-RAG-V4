# MCP-RAG-V4 Structure Analysis

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Broken Worktree Implementation
- **Problem**: Worktrees were created incorrectly, agents can't access projects
- **Current State**: 
  - Agent workspaces in `/agents/builder-workspace/` instead of `.worktrees/`
  - Nested agent folders inside agent folders (agents/builder-workspace/agents/)
  - Projects manually copied into workspaces (duplication)
- **Impact**: Agents can't run npm install or access code properly

### 2. MCP Server Issues
- **Problem**: MCP enhanced server exists but not properly integrated
- **Current State**:
  - MCP server at `/.mcp/enhanced-server.ts`
  - RAG store empty at `/.mcp/rag-store/`
  - Memory bank has data but MCP can't access it
- **Impact**: No real RAG functionality, agents can't query patterns

### 3. Agent Communication Breakdown
- **Problem**: No inter-agent communication mechanism
- **Current State**:
  - Agents work in isolation
  - No MCP connections between agents
  - Task updates only through ACTIVE_TASKS.json
- **Impact**: No collaboration, duplicate work, no context sharing

### 4. Structural Confusion
- **Problem**: Multiple conflicting organizational patterns
- **Current State**:
  - Projects in `/projects/`
  - Agent rules in `/agents/*/CLAUDE.md`
  - Coordination in `/coordination/`
  - MCP config in `/.mcp/`
  - Random scripts everywhere
- **Impact**: Agents don't know where to find things

### 5. Task Management Issues
- **Problem**: Agents claim tasks complete but don't execute
- **Current State**:
  - ACTIVE_TASKS.json shows "COMPLETED" for unfinished work
  - No verification mechanism
  - No way to track actual vs reported progress
- **Impact**: False completion reports, broken deployments

### 6. Environment Isolation Failures
- **Problem**: Agents can't install dependencies or run commands
- **Current State**:
  - Security restrictions prevent cd to project directories
  - Can't run npm install even with Bash tool
  - Limited to file operations only
- **Impact**: Complete codebases with no working functionality

## Root Causes

1. **Improper Worktree Setup**: Not following git worktree best practices
2. **MCP Misconfiguration**: Server exists but not connected to agents
3. **No Agent Orchestration**: Missing swarm/squad pattern implementation
4. **Conflicting Patterns**: Mixing different approaches without clear architecture
5. **Tool Limitations**: Agents have tools but can't use them effectively

## Requirements for Perfect System

Based on research and our needs:
1. **Proper Git Worktrees**: Each agent needs isolated full repo access
2. **MCP Integration**: Inter-agent communication via MCP protocol
3. **Task Verification**: Actual execution tracking, not just status updates
4. **Clear Structure**: One source of truth for each concern
5. **Agent Autonomy**: Ability to install deps, run tests, deploy
6. **Orchestration Layer**: Coordinator to manage agent collaboration
