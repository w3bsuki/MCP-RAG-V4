  "content": "Dashboard Architecture Pattern for Multi-Agent System Monitoring\n\nTechnology Stack:\n- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Zustand (state management) + Tailwind CSS + Recharts\n- Backend: Node.js + Express + Socket.io + Chokidar (file watching)\n- Real-time: WebSocket for live updates, REST API for data queries\n- Build Tools: Vite (frontend), nodemon (backend development)\n\nKey Design Decisions:\n1. Zustand chosen over Redux for lightweight TypeScript-friendly state management\n2. Read-only monitoring approach to prevent interference with agent operations\n3. File system watching with Chokidar for coordination file changes\n4. WebSocket events with optimistic UI updates and periodic full sync\n5. Component hierarchy following atomic design pattern\n\nArchitecture Layers:\n- Presentation Layer: React components with clear separation of concerns\n- State Management: Zustand stores with real-time WebSocket integration\n- API Layer: Express REST endpoints + Socket.io for real-time events\n- Integration Layer: File watchers, Git monitoring, MCP client\n- Data Sources: Coordination files, Git worktrees, MCP server\n\nPerformance Targets:\n- Initial load: <2 seconds\n- Update latency: <100ms\n- Memory usage: <100MB backend, <50MB frontend\n- WebSocket reconnection with exponential backoff\n\nThis pattern provides real-time monitoring capabilities while maintaining system isolation and performance.",
