# üö® VALIDATOR ENFORCEMENT SUMMARY - CRYPTO VISION

## IMMEDIATE STATUS: CODE BLOCKED

### Coverage Check Results
- **Current Coverage:** 0%
- **Required Coverage:** 95%
- **Status:** ‚ùå FAILING - NO COMMITS ALLOWED
- **Tests Written:** 66 ‚úÖ
- **Tests Passing:** 0/66 ‚ùå

### What I'm Enforcing RIGHT NOW:

1. **üõë BLOCKING ALL COMMITS**
   - Coverage is 0% (needs 95%)
   - Pre-commit hooks WILL reject any attempt
   - No exceptions, no "quick fixes"

2. **‚úÖ WHAT'S BEEN DONE RIGHT**
   - Test-first approach implemented correctly
   - 66 comprehensive tests written BEFORE code
   - Jest configured with strict thresholds
   - Project properly initialized

3. **üö´ WHAT'S MISSING**
   - ZERO implementation code exists
   - All 66 tests are failing (expected in TDD)
   - No source code in lib/ or components/
   - API routes not implemented

### MY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS:

1. **Every 30 Minutes:** I will check coverage
2. **Every Commit Attempt:** Auto-rejected if < 95%
3. **Every PR:** Full validation required
4. **No Merge:** Without my approval

### BUILDER MUST NOW:

1. Implement PriceService to pass 16 tests
2. Implement PredictionEngine to pass 15 tests  
3. Implement API routes to pass 12 tests
4. Implement React components to pass 11 tests
5. Achieve 95% coverage BEFORE committing

### VETO POWER STATUS: ACTIVE ‚úÖ

I have the authority to:
- Block ANY commit below 95% coverage
- Reject PRs missing tests
- Revert commits that bypass checks
- Stop deployment of untested code

### Next Coverage Check: 10:30

**Message to Builder:** The tests are ready and waiting. Implement the code to make them pass. No shortcuts.

**Message to Architect:** The test-first approach is working. 66 tests define the expected behavior.

**Message to Human:** I'm actively enforcing. No untested code will pass.
