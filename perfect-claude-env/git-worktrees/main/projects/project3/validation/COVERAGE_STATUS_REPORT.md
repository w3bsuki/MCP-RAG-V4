## 🛑 ENFORCEMENT STATUS

### Pre-Commit Blocking
- ✅ Coverage check on every commit
- ✅ Automatic rejection < 95%
- ✅ TypeScript compilation check
- ✅ Linting enforcement

### What Will Be BLOCKED
1. Any commit with < 95% line coverage
2. Any commit with < 90% branch coverage
3. Any PR without passing tests
4. Any deployment without E2E tests

---

## 📈 Required Implementation Path

### Priority 1: Core Services (31 tests)
1. **PriceService** (16 tests)
   - WebSocket connection
   - Real-time updates
   - Error handling
   - Reconnection logic

2. **PredictionEngine** (15 tests)
   - Claude API integration
   - Prediction generation
   - Confidence calculations
   - Rate limiting

### Priority 2: API Routes (12 tests)
- POST /api/predictions
- GET /api/predictions
- Error responses
- Rate limiting

### Priority 3: React Components (11 tests)
- PriceDisplay component
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Real-time updates

### Priority 4: Monitoring (12 tests)
- Coverage tracking
- Real-time monitoring
- Trend analysis

## ⚠️ VALIDATOR WARNINGS

### Critical Issues
1. **ZERO implementation exists**
2. **0% coverage blocks ALL commits**
3. **66 tests waiting for code**
4. **TDD approach correctly started**

### Required Actions
- Builder MUST implement code to pass tests
- Cannot skip to new features
- Must achieve 95% before ANY commit
- No exceptions for "quick fixes"

## 📊 Coverage Monitoring Schedule

| Check Time | Action | Enforcement |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Every 30 min | Run coverage check | Document results |
| Every commit | Block if < 95% | Prevent push |
| Every PR | Full validation | Block merge |
| Daily | Trend report | Track progress |

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Project will ONLY be considered successful when:
- ✅ 95%+ line coverage achieved
- ✅ 90%+ branch coverage achieved
- ✅ All 66 tests passing
- ✅ E2E tests implemented
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met
- ✅ Security scan clean

---

**VALIDATOR PLEDGE:** No untested code will pass. Period.

**Next Coverage Check:** 10:30 (in 30 minutes)
