# MCP/RAG System Rules

## Core Principles
1. **Best Practices First** - Every decision must follow proven patterns
2. **Document Everything** - Use MCP tools, not direct file edits
3. **Test Before Deploy** - No code without validation
4. **Learn & Improve** - Query RAG before implementing, store after success

## MCP Tool Usage (MANDATORY)
- **Before ANY implementation**: `mcp__ragStore__search` for patterns
- **After EVERY success**: `mcp__ragStore__upsert` to store knowledge
- **Coordination updates**: Use `sync_project_state`, never edit directly
- **Context checks**: `mcp__ragStore__get_context` at session start

## Agent Rules
- **Architect**: Plans only, no code. Updates PROJECT_PLAN.md
- **Builder**: Implements only. Queries RAG first, commits often
- **Validator**: Tests everything. Can block any deployment

## Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode always
- Error handling required
- >90% test coverage
- Git commits every 30-60 minutes
- Descriptive commit messages

## Workflow
1. Read coordination docs first
2. Check task-board.json for assignments  
3. Query RAG for patterns
4. Implement/test/validate
5. Update progress immediately
6. Store successful patterns

## Anti-Patterns (FORBIDDEN)
- ❌ Implementing without RAG search
- ❌ Skipping tests "to save time"
- ❌ Direct file edits for coordination
- ❌ Working outside assigned worktree
- ❌ Ignoring validator feedback

## Emergency Protocol
If blocked: Document in task-board.json immediately
If failing: Query RAG for similar issues
If unclear: Get full context before proceeding

Remember: Good architecture enables good implementation. The system learns from every success.
