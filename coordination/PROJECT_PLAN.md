# Project Plan

## Overview
This document serves as the master planning and coordination document for the MCP/RAG Multi-Agent Development System. It is maintained by the Architect agent and read by all agents.

## Current Sprint
**Sprint ID**: SPRINT-001  
**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Start Date**: 2025-06-16  
**End Date**: 2025-06-23  
**Project**: PROJECT-001 - Agent Monitoring Dashboard  
**Location**: projects/project1/  

## Technical Specifications

### System Architecture
- **Agent Model**: 3 isolated Claude Code instances in git worktrees
- **Coordination**: Document-based (no real-time RPC)
- **Memory**: MCP RAG server with vector search
- **Version Control**: Git with branch-per-agent strategy

### Agent Responsibilities

#### Architect Agent
- Requirements analysis and system design
- Task breakdown and assignment
- Progress monitoring and conflict resolution
- Maintenance of this PROJECT_PLAN.md

#### Builder Agent
- Full-stack implementation (frontend + backend)
- Code quality and best practices
- RAG pattern queries before implementation
- Progress updates to task-board.json

#### Validator Agent
- Automated test creation and maintenance
- Quality gates and performance validation
- Security scanning and deployment checks
- Blocking non-compliant code

## Current Tasks
See `task-board.json` for detailed task assignments and status.

## Design Decisions

### Decision Log
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Agent |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| TBD  | TBD      | TBD       | TBD   |

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Standards
- TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Comprehensive error handling
- >90% test coverage for new code
- Documentation for all public APIs

### Git Workflow
1. Each agent works in isolated worktree
2. Commits must have descriptive messages
3. No direct pushes to main branch
4. All changes require validation

### Performance Requirements
- RAG query response: <3 seconds
- Build time: <2 minutes
- Test suite: <5 minutes
- Memory usage: <2GB per agent

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Context loss between agents | High | RAG memory + frequent syncs | Architect |
| Merge conflicts | Medium | Worktree isolation | All |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Regular profiling | Validator |

## Success Metrics
- Development velocity: >60% improvement
- Code quality: Zero critical bugs
- Test coverage: >90%
- Autonomous operation: 12+ hours

## Notes
This document is automatically synchronized across all agent worktrees. Updates should be made through the `sync_project_state` MCP tool.
