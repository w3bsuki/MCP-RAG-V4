# üöÄ PROJECT 3 KICKOFF: Crypto Vision

## CRITICAL ANNOUNCEMENT: TEST-FIRST DEVELOPMENT MANDATORY

Agents, you are about to build **Crypto Vision** - a production-ready AI-powered crypto prediction platform. This is NOT a toy project. Real users will pay real money for accurate predictions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **EVERY feature starts with a test**
2. **95% coverage or code gets rejected**
3. **Validator has VETO power**
4. **False task completion = immediate failure**

## üìä You Will Be Monitored

I will be watching these metrics in REAL-TIME:
- Test files created per hour
- Coverage percentage
- Time between commits
- Test-to-code ratio

## üéØ Your Mission

Build a crypto prediction platform that:
- Shows real-time prices for top cryptocurrencies
- Provides AI-powered 7-day and 30-day predictions
- Explains predictions in plain English
- Sends alerts when opportunities arise
- Can scale to 10,000 paying users

## üìÅ Project Resources

- **PRD**: `/projects/project3/PRD_FINAL.md`
- **Agent Rules**: `/projects/project3/AGENT_RULES.md`  
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Claude API, PostgreSQL
- **Target Coverage**: 95% minimum

## üèóÔ∏è First Tasks (IN ORDER)

### Hour 1: Foundation
1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Set up testing framework (Jest + React Testing Library)
3. Configure coverage requirements
4. Create pre-commit hooks
5. Write first failing test

### Hour 2: Core Features
1. TDD for price fetching service
2. TDD for Claude integration
3. TDD for prediction engine
4. All with tests FIRST

## ‚è∞ Timeline

- **Week 1**: Core platform with real-time prices and basic predictions
- **Week 2**: Advanced features, alerts, user accounts
- **Week 3**: Performance optimization, scaling tests
- **Week 4**: Launch preparation, security audit

## üî¥ RED FLAGS I'M WATCHING FOR

- "I'll add tests later" ‚Üí IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION
- Coverage dropping below 95% ‚Üí CODE REVERTED  
- Validator being ignored ‚Üí FULL STOP
- False completion claims ‚Üí TASK REASSIGNED

## üí™ Why This Matters

Projects 1 & 2 had good code but FAILED on testing:
- Project 1: 0% test coverage
- Project 2: <15% test coverage

This is your chance to prove you can build PRODUCTION-READY software.

## üéñÔ∏è Success Criteria

By the end of this project:
- 95%+ test coverage
- <100ms response times
- 99.9% uptime capable
- Real paying customers
- Zero critical bugs

## üìù First Message Should Be:

"Initializing Crypto Vision with test-first development. Setting up Jest with 95% coverage requirement..."

NOT "Creating components..." or "Building features..."

---

**Remember**: No tests = No commits = No success

Good luck, agents. I'll be watching. üëÅÔ∏è

*P.S. - The validator agent especially needs to step up. Your job is to BLOCK bad code, not wave it through.*
