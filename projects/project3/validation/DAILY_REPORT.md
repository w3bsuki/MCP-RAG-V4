# Daily Validation Report - 2025-06-17

## 🚨 Coverage Summary
- **Overall Coverage:** 0% ❌ CRITICAL - BELOW 95% REQUIREMENT
- **Files Tested:** 0/0 (No implementation exists yet)
- **Critical Paths:** 0% covered
- **Status:** BLOCKED - NO IMPLEMENTATION

## 📊 Test Infrastructure Status
- **Total Test Suites:** 5 ✅
- **Total Tests Written:** 66 ✅
- **Tests Passing:** 0/66 (Expected - TDD approach)
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Configured ✅
- **Coverage Enforcement:** Active ✅

## Quality Gate Results
- **Tests Added:** 66 (All written before implementation)
- **Tests Passing:** 0/66 ❌
- **Performance Benchmarks:** NOT MEASURABLE (No code)
- **Security Scan:** NOT APPLICABLE (No code)
- **TypeScript Compilation:** NOT TESTED (No implementation)

## 🛑 Blocked Items
### CRITICAL BLOCK: No Implementation Code
- **Reason:** Tests written but zero implementation exists
- **Required Action:** Builder must implement code to pass tests
- **Current Coverage:** 0% (95% required)
- **Enforcement:** Pre-commit hooks will block any commits below 95%

## 📈 Test Categories Written
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - PriceService: 16 tests ✅
   - PredictionEngine: 15 tests ✅
   - CoverageMonitor: 12 tests ✅
   - PriceDisplay Component: 11 tests ✅

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - API Predictions: 12 tests ✅

3. **E2E Tests:** Pending (framework ready)

## ⚠️ Validator Observations
1. **Positive:** Test-first approach correctly implemented
2. **Positive:** 66 comprehensive tests written before code
3. **Critical:** Zero implementation means 0% coverage
4. **Required:** Builder must now implement code to pass tests

## 🎯 Next Required Actions
1. **Builder MUST:**
   - Implement PriceService to pass 16 tests
   - Implement PredictionEngine to pass 15 tests
   - Implement API routes to pass 12 tests
   - Implement React components to pass 11 tests
   - Achieve 95% coverage before ANY commit

2. **Validator WILL:**
   - Monitor coverage every 30 minutes
   - Block all commits below 95%
   - Verify each implementation passes tests
   - Track coverage trend

## 📊 Coverage Trend
| Time | Coverage | Status | Action |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| 10:00 | 0% | ❌ FAIL | Tests written, no implementation |

## 🚫 Enforcement Log
- **Pre-commit hook:** Active and will block commits < 95%
- **Manual verification:** Required before any merge
- **Zero tolerance:** No exceptions for "small changes"

## 💡 Recommendations
1. Start with PriceService implementation (16 tests ready)
2. Use TDD cycle: Red → Green → Refactor
3. Run `npm test:coverage` after each function implementation
4. Do NOT attempt to commit until 95% coverage achieved
