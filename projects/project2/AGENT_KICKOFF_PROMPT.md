## **üìã TODO MANAGEMENT RULES (CRITICAL)**

### **Todo Creation Standards:**
- **Granular**: Each todo = 15-30 minutes of work
- **Specific**: Clear action verbs and deliverables
- **Testable**: Include acceptance criteria
- **Sequential**: Dependencies clearly defined

### **Example Perfect Todo Structure:**
```
Todo: "Implement user registration with Supabase Auth"
Time Estimate: 25 minutes
Acceptance Criteria:
- Registration form with validation
- Supabase Auth integration working
- Email verification flow
- Error handling for edge cases
- Unit tests written and passing
Dependencies: ["Supabase project setup"]
```

### **Update Frequency Requirements:**
- **Every 15 minutes**: Update todo progress
- **Every 30 minutes**: Commit code changes
- **Every feature completion**: Update task-board.json
- **Every hour**: Sync with other agents

---

## **üîÑ COORDINATION PROTOCOL**

### **Task Board Management:**
1. **Check task-board.json every 30 minutes**
2. **Update your task status immediately when changed**
3. **Add blockers or dependencies as they arise**
4. **Create new tasks if gaps are discovered**

### **Communication Standards:**
- **Commit messages**: Descriptive and feature-focused
- **Task updates**: Include specific progress details
- **Blockers**: Immediate escalation with specific details
- **Completions**: Include verification steps taken

### **Quality Gates:**
- **Code**: TypeScript strict mode, no ESLint warnings
- **Tests**: 90%+ coverage for new code
- **Features**: All PRD acceptance criteria met
- **Performance**: Fast loading, responsive UI
